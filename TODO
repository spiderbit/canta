- moving LabeList, CubeList and certanly CubeObserver away from Observers
- renaming Observers (all with or without Observer in name)
- try to make buttons/labbels without pudding
- item_group file contains Menugroup class ( class names should be the same
as package names)
- We need a seperation of the look and the content of our menu and we could then define the content in an xml file
- Some stuff could be out of our vcs, language files, changelog
- the distribute Makefile target needs to be better, deleting stuff and make
all so we can upload the tar.gz directly, optionaly packaging to deb/rpm and
windows-installer
