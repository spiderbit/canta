commit  80949f3924d3dfc4fb191c7c446196b5a818676f

causes several bugs:

- if you start a song, quit it after some seconds -> choose another song ->
  start again the same song -> it starts on the position it stopt before
  expected reaction: it should start from the beginning

- if you change output-sound-engine and save without restart it crash
  because the new engine is not reinitialised
